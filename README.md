## Usage

Using Dragula in your SwiftUI project is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Dragula

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var items: [String] = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]

    var body: some View {
        Dragula(items: $items) { item in
            Text(item)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.blue)
                .cornerRadius(8)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a list of items that users can drag and drop. You can easily modify the `items` array to fit your needs.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of how you can implement Dragula in your projects:

### Example 1: Reorderable List

Create a simple reorderable list with drag-and-drop functionality.

```swift
struct ReorderableListView: View {
    @State private var items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date"]

    var body: some View {
        Dragula(items: $items) { item in
            Text(item)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.green)
                .cornerRadius(5)
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Styling

Customize the appearance of the draggable items.

```swift
struct CustomStyledView: View {
    @State private var items = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]

    var body: some View {
        Dragula(items: $items) { item in
            Text(item)
                .padding()
                .background(item == "Red" ? Color.red : item == "Green" ? Color.green : Color.blue)
                .cornerRadius(10)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Dynamic Data

Integrate Dragula with dynamic data sources.

```swift
struct DynamicDataView: View {
    @State private var items: [String] = []

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Load Data") {
                items = ["Item A", "Item B", "Item C"]
            }
            Dragula(items: $items) { item in
                Text(item)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.purple)
                    .cornerRadius(4)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
